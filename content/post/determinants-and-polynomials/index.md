#### Part (a)

Find the determinant of the following (real-valued) matrix

$$\begin{pmatrix}
1 &\alpha &\alpha^2 & \alpha^3\\\\
1 &\beta &\beta^2 & \beta^3\\\\
1 &\gamma &\gamma^2 & \gamma^3\\\\
1 &\delta &\delta^2 & \delta^3\\\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### Part (b)

Given a paired set $\mathcal{D} = \\\{(x_i,y_i) | i=1,\dots,4 \\\}$, show that there is exactly one polynomial $P(x)=\sum_{k=0}^4 a_kx^k$ which passes through the points $\mathcal{D}$.
