- Challenges are open to UBD students only.
- Submissions are to be made by uploading scanned PDF copy of their solutions (or better yet, using $\LaTeX$).
- Only complete solutions may be considered for the prize.
- In the event that multiple correct and complete solutions are received, the winning submission will be determined by way of majority voting by the site's contributors on the criteria of originality, elegance and succinctness.
